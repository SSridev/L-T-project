# L-T-project
Aim:
This project demonstrates how to create an Arduino-based Earthquake Detector Alarm with a seismic graph.
We utilize the ADXL335 3-axis accelerometer as a sensor to detect any tilting, trembling, or shaking movement indicative of an earthquake. 
We interface the ADXL335 accelerometer with an Arduino and incorporate an LCD display to visualize seismic activity, resulting in the Earthquake Detector Alarm with a Seismic Graph.

Result:
We have made a earthqauke detector alarm using arduino uno, ,accelerometer, and lcd display.
also ploting the graph wth the help of processing ide.
